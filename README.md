# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Professional Summary
I am an aspiring SOC Analyst transitioning into cybersecurity after completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I bring over 16 years of experience in mortgage underwriting, financial risk analysis, and working in regulated environments. My background includes evaluating complex financial documentation, validating borrower information, identifying inconsistencies, and making high-impact risk decisions aligned with federal and investor guidelines.

These skills translate directly into security operations, where analytical thinking, attention to detail, documentation accuracy, and risk-based decision making are essential. Through my cybersecurity training, I have gained hands-on experience in SIEM searching, log investigation, Linux file permissions, SQL filtering, malware analysis, and incident documentation. This portfolio highlights practical projects that demonstrate my ability to analyze security events, detect suspicious activity, and document incidents clearly and professionally.
